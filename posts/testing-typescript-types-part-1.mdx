We often test our JavaScript or TypeScript code, but what about TypeScript types?

As we start using [type assertions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions)â€”which could be a bit confusing at first because it doesn't assert anything, it tells the compiler to trust usâ€”we might want to test them to ensure it is the case today and tomorrow.

Before we jump into details of how to test TypeScript types, let's see what led me there.

> [!NOTE]

## Preamble

We had a specific context where we were migrating from a REST API to a GraphQL API, the data on the REST API was represented as an [enum](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#enums), but the GraphQL API used a union of [string literals](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-types):

```typescript
enum OldEnum {
  Apple = 'apple',
  Orange = 'orange',
}

type NewUnion = 'apple' | 'orange';
//   ^? type NewUnion = "apple" | "orange"
```

We can see that they are both equivalent because they will both contain the same values, but the compiler doesn't know that, or not quite yet.

If we have a function that takes an `OldEnum` as a parameter, we can't pass a `NewUnion` to it because the compiler doesn't know that they are equivalent:

```typescript
function doSomethingWithOldEnum(param: OldEnum) {
  console.log(param);
}

doSomethingWithOldEnum(OldEnum.Apple); // OK
doSomethingWithOldEnum('apple');
// ^ Argument of type '"apple"' is not assignable to parameter of type 'OldEnum'.(2345)
```

Doing the reverse situation would have been possible because we can validate an enum value against a union of string literals:

```typescript
function doSomethingWithNewUnion(param: NewUnion) {
  console.log(param);
}

doSomethingWithNewUnion('apple'); // OK
doSomethingWithNewUnion(OldEnum.Apple); // OK
```

But how do we pass `NewUnion` to a function that expects an `OldEnum`?

We'll need to use a [type assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions) to tell the compiler to trust us because we visually confirmed that they are both equivalent, and therefore we're letting the compiler know:

```typescript
function convertNewUnionToOldEnum(param: NewUnion) {
  return param as OldEnum;
}

const value = convertNewUnionToOldEnum('apple');
//    ^? const value: OldEnum

doSomethingWithOldEnum(value); // OK
```

As of today, we know that both types are equivalent, and that's why we can use a type assertion to tell the compiler to trust us. But what about tomorrow? What if we add a new value to the `OldEnum`? What if we remove one? What if we rename one? They won't be 1:1 anymore.

This is where a test for a TypeScript type could be useful!

## Early Solution

Here, I'll present the early solution I adopted for this use case because I couldn't find a better one at the time. I believe it is still useful, but could be a little bit confusing at first. I will explain why.

First thing we need to do, is exactly like we did previously, we need to assert that both types are equivalent. But how to compare them?

First, we can convert the enum into a union of string literals using a [template literal](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/template-literal-types.html):

```typescript
// We can convert the old enum into a union with template literal
type OldEnumAsUnion = `${OldEnum}`;
//   ^? type OldEnumAsUnion = "apple" | "orange"
```

Then, we can visually assert that they are equivalent:

```typescript
type NewUnion = 'apple' | 'orange';
//   ^? type NewUnion = "apple" | "orange"
```

From here, all we have to do is to turn this in a TypeScript error if they are not.

Here's a helper type we can create to do that, it will check if the two provided types are contrained with each other:

```typescript
/**
 * Helper type to assert that a type is exactly equal to another type.
 *
 * @example
 * type Example = IsExact<NewUnion, 'apple' | 'orange'>;
 * //   ^? type Example = true
 */
export type IsExact<T, U> = [T] extends [U]
  ? [U] extends [T]
    ? true
    : false
  : false;
```

Since it's a type and can't be used as-is, we need to combine it to an assert function. The name here could be a little bit confusing because it doesn't assert anything at runtime (the function body is empty), actually, the function will be totally no-op at runtime. Also, it has **nothing** to do with [assertion functions](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#assertion-functions) from TypeScript.

```typescript
/**
 * A function to assert a type is exactly equal to another type at compile time (no-op at runtime).
 *
 * Initially introduced for GraphQL <> REST API adapters as we used to have enums to represent values,
 * and we now rely on union types. In most cases, values expressed by enums are the same as the union types,
 * but we want to ensure that we don't drift away from the original values so we can safely cast them.
 *
 * @param expectTrue - A boolean value that should be true if the type is exactly equal to another type.
 *
 * @example
 * assertType<IsExact<NewUnion, 'apple' | 'orange'>>(true);
 */
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars -- this is expected as the function doesn't do anything at runtime
export function assertType<T extends true | false>(expectTrue: T) {}
```

Finally, we can go back to the convert function we created earlier and use the `assertType` function to turn the type assertion into a **type-safe assertion**!

```typescript
function convertNewUnionToOldEnum(param: NewUnion) {
  assertType<IsExact<NewUnion, OldEnumAsUnion>>(true);

  return param as OldEnum;
}
```

Doing such will make sure that it is always safe to cast `NewUnion` to `OldEnum` and that we won't drift away from the original values.

Even though the solution described here could be convenient, it had some cons as well. It's a little bit weird to see a no-op function called at runtime for TypeScript, the assert function won't change anything to types, and therefore it could be silently removed. It will generate an error at compile-time if both types aren't matching, but it would be more discoverable if it was part of the test suite rather than the compilation process.
