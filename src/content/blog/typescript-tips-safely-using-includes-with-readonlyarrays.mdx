I recently tried to use [`includes`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes) on a [`ReadonlyArray`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html#the-readonlyarray-type), which was a subset of the value's type, and I was surprised to see that TypeScript wasn't letting me do it because it was expecting the full range of the superset:

```
Argument of type 'SUPERSET' is not assignable to parameter of type 'SUBSET'.
```

It seems smart to guard against that because in some cases it doesn't make sense if they don't overlap perfectly, but in some cases, like mine, it does!

I looked online for a solution as I didn't want to just cast it as a string, but I was a little bit deceived by the solutions I found as I wanted to preserve the existing type safety and even narrow down based on the condition, so I wanted to share a new perspective on it!

## Issue

First of all, let's define a test scenario where we have a list of fruits and a subset of them defined as top picks:

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```typescript
const FRUITS = [
  //  ^? const FRUITS: readonly ["Apple", "Banana", ...
  'Apple',
  'Banana',
  'Orange',
  'Grape',
  'Watermelon',
  'Pineapple',
  'Mango',
  'Strawberry',
  'Peach',
  'Pear',
] as const;

type AllFruits = typeof FRUITS[number];

// This is a subset of `FRUITS`
const TOP_PICKS = ['Apple', 'Peach'] as const satisfies ReadonlyArray<AllFruits>;
//    ^? const TOP_PICKS: readonly ["Apple", "Peach"...
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

Here, we would like to check whether the selection (`FRUITS`) is part of the `TOP_PICKS` (subset of `FRUITS`), which could be useful if we would like to display a distinctive element for "top pick" elements, e.g., a star.

If we want to check whether the selection is part of the subset `TOP_PICKS`, TypeScript won't let us do it. Because it knows that our two literal arrays don't match as `selection` is typed based on its superset: `FRUITS`. TypeScript knows that not all members of the superset are present in the subset (obviously, right? It's a subset of the domain). TypeScript believes it could be a mistake, unless that's exactly what you want to do.

{/* prettier-ignore-start */}
```typescript
function scenario(selection: AllFruits) {
  if (TOP_PICKS.includes(selection)) { // Argument of type '"Apple" | "Banana" | "Orange" | "Grape" | "Watermelon" | "Pineapple" | "Mango" | "Strawberry" | "Peach" | "Pear"' is not assignable to parameter of type '"Apple" | "Peach"'.
    // Do something.
  }
}
```
{/* prettier-ignore-end */}

We need to widen the type of `TOP_PICKS` to be able to check whether a selection is included in it, and hopefully, retain type safety!

First we can try out widening `TOP_PICKS` by casting it as `ReadonlyArray<string>` and you can see that it works! (or kind of)

```typescript
function scenario(selection: AllFruits) {
  if ((TOP_PICKS as ReadonlyArray<string>).includes(selection)) {
    const selectionType = selection;
    //    ^? const selectionType: "Apple" | "Banana" | "...
  } else {
    const selectionType = selection;
    //    ^? const selectionType: "Apple" | "Banana" | "...
  }
}
```

But... it feels like cheating a little bit when we know that it can't be a string, but only literals. It's kind of defeating the purpose of building arrays of literals, but at least, it doesn't turn `selection` type into `string`!

We could be a little bit more precise here, rather than casting it as `string`, we could widen the type of `TOP_PICKS` to expand it to the full domain of its supset, so it does match with `selection` type.

```typescript
function scenario(selection: AllFruits) {
  if ((TOP_PICKS as ReadonlyArray<AllFruits>).includes(selection)) {
    const selectionType = selection;
    //    ^? const selectionType: "Apple" | "Banana" | "...
  } else {
    const selectionType = selection;
    //    ^? const selectionType: "Apple" | "Banana" | "...
  }
}
```

It works! But still, there's something weird, or at least, not satisfactory.

What's the point in building literals if it doesn't narrow the type of `selection` in conditions?

Meaning that, within the if/else condition, we know that if `selection` was included in `TOP_PICKS`, then it means `selection` could only be a value included in `TOP_PICKS`, not the full range!

## Solution

Let's extract the exact same logic we used previously, but this time, we'll define it in its own function as a [type guard](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html) combined with a [type predicate](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#using-type-predicates)!

```typescript
function isTopPick(
  selection: AllFruits,
): selection is (typeof TOP_PICKS)[number] {
  return (TOP_PICKS as ReadonlyArray<AllFruits>).includes(selection);
}
```

We do expect to receive a `selection`, which could be any fruits.

Then, we upcast `TOP_PICKS` as its superset (`FRUITS`), which we call `includes` with two matching types.

Finally, we define a type predicate as the function of a type guard returning whether `selection` is a top pick or not.

Combined to a type predicate, we can tell TypeScript that if the type guard returns `true`, it means that the `selection` is in fact a `TOP_PICKS`!

The beauty of this can be observed here, we were able to check if a value (superset) was included in a (subset) while preserving its type safety, but not only that, we also narrowed down the `selection` type!

If `isTopPick` returns `true`, the `selection` type is narrowed down to `"Apple" | "Peach"`.

```typescript
function scenario(selection: AllFruits) {
  if (isTopPick(selection)) {
    const selectionType = selection;
    //    ^? const selectionType: "Apple" | "Peach"
  } else {
    const selectionType = selection;
    //    ^? const selectionType: "Banana" | "Orange" | ...
  }
}
```
