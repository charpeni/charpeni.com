John had always been passionate about technology and spent years working as a software engineer. But after a while, he began to feel burnt out and yearned for a change of pace. He decided to follow his dream of starting a rotisserie chicken business and left the tech industry to pursue his new venture.

Everything was going well. John's rotisserie chickens were a hit, and business was booming. But as time passed, John became overwhelmed with the chicken demands and began cutting corners to keep up. He started reducing the cooking time for the chickens so he could deliver them quickly.

Cooks were telling John that chickens weren't ready yet, they needed more time. Unfortunately, John didn't see that situation the same way and told them to deliver anyway. John thought he could make customers happy by quickly delivering an uncooked product to get more customers and then optimize the cooking process. John called this a temporary situation and mentioned something about iterations.

At first, the customers didn't notice the difference. But as time passed, more and more people began to complain about the uncooked chickens they were receiving. John's once-thriving business began to suffer as customers lost trust in the quality of his products, even though chickens were always delivered quickly.

In the end, John learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of cutting corners. Just like cooking a perfectly roasted chicken, delivering high-quality software requires patience and attention to detail. If you rush through the cooking process and deliver the chicken before it is fully cooked, it could cause food poisoning or other serious health issues.

In conclusion, delivering things too quickly in software engineering is like cooking chicken â€“ it is important to find the right balance between speed and quality in order to produce a high-quality, reliable product. By taking the time to plan and execute tasks properly, you can avoid the pitfalls of rushing through development and end up with a product that is a success.
